Time's up, yeah you should've known
Pretty little princess put it in a hole
Cold expect its not a disease
Can you take a photograph of us for them to see
Bam bam bam trick or treat want to stay
You can do it ours and we will do it your way
Not so bad if you follow the plan
That's how it goes with your head in the sand

We've already lost control
Already lost control
We've already lost control
Already lost control
Can't we join an army of you
And help you out in battle, defend your point of view
Turn tables, its just like you said
Now I'm in the army probably better off dead
Jam slam wam I forgot what to say
You can take the bows and ride along the highway
Just thought you maybe would understand
What goes down in a rock 'n' roll band

We've already lost control
Already lost control
We've already lost control
Already lost control

No fun cause its all been done
Picture perfect prefect thinks he's fucking won
Read out the list and see if it's free
Now I'm in your photographs as pretty as can be
Jam slam mam was it something I said
When inside a moment I talk above my head
I love shit when it gets outta hand
Smoke the grass quicker and then go rock the band

We've already lost control
Already lost control
We've already lost control
Already lost control
